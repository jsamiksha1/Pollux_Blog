          <!-- <p>Lee is the everyday performance denim brand. Since the dawn of our denim, our inspiration and guide has been real life experiences. We believe that clothing should be designed to fit the needs of the people wearing it.</p> -->
          <!-- <p>We have held this belief to our heart from the beginning, when we started up in Greensboro, North Carolina. We embarked on a platform of innovation and with an idea to create the best-possible jeans, jackets and shirts for cowboys. We added special features. We added functionality. For instance, flat rivets that wouldn't scratch your saddle, watch pockets, seven belt loops (instead of the usual five), and yoke seam over panel for keeping your wallet in place. Functional design details still remain vital, adapting to modern looks and needs.</p> -->
          <p></p>
          <p>The best ideas can change who we are. WordPad is where those ideas take shape, take off, and spark powerful conversations.We are an open platform where readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking. Here, expert and undiscovered voices alike dive into the heart of any topic and bring new ideas to the surface. 
          Our purpose is to spread these ideas and deepen understanding of the world.We are creating a new model for digital publishing.
          One that supports nuance, complexity, and vital storytelling without
          giving in to the incentives of advertising. It's an environment thats open to everyone but promotes substance and authenticity. 
          And it's where deeper connections forged between readers and writers can lead to discovery and growth. 
          Together with millions of collaborators, we are building a trusted and vibrant ecosystem fueled by important 
          ideas and the people who think about them.</p>
